### Project Context & Setup

- Working on a hardware-related project involving synthesis and place/route analysis
- Created new GitHub repository named “hardware” to avoid conflicts with existing repo
- Added Rohit Kanaga as collaborator
- Need to use transformers library and LLAMA causal model
- No mandatory GPU requirement for fine-tuning, though helpful

### Data Processing Requirements

- Need to format and clean synthesis data (not synthetic data)
- Will require data loading and synthesizing capabilities
- Must understand gate and arrow structures
- Team will use transformers library components
- Rohit will provide specific synthesis data for analysis

### Timeline & Deliverables

- Presentation to class scheduled for Thursday
- Presentation to Bora scheduled for Monday
- Need to reach checkpoint status before presentations
- Will work together over weekend via Zoom calls
- Agreed to dedicate 2 full days to project work

### Technical Infrastructure

- Discussion about ProFlexity Pro tool - recommended to sign up for 3 licenses
- Repository will include README with guidelines
- Will implement multi-agent collaborative framework
- Need to integrate JPG output functionality
- Planning to use LLAMA causal implementation from transformers library

### Next Steps

- Rohit to upload required data to repository
- Arihant to research synthesis and place/route concepts
- Team to begin data formatting once data is available
- Will meet in Berkeley for in-person collaboration
- Need to review transformers library documentation
